# Introduction

Welcome to the WordToken Developer API. 

The API can be used to access public conversations, messages, and interlocutors on the WordToken platform. In addition to retrieving these resources, the api exposes functionality for sorting, filtering, and pagination. 

Every resource is made accessible using standard REST based principles. HTTP Verbs (e.g, GET, POST, DELETE) are used to facilitate HTTP Requests and API errors are handled using the appropriate HTTP status codes. All responses to the API are returned in JSON form unless using the NodeJS library, where the response will be a JavaScript Object.

The API can be consumed programmatically using supported langauge bindings for shell and node such as cURL via the terminal and the WordToken NPM library which you may import into your client or server-side application. Every request made via the API requires authentication via a WordToken API Key. You may find instructions for generating a Developer API key under the authentication tab below.

<aside class="notice">Overtime, and as demand requires, coverage for additional langauge bindings may be offered. At the moment, feel free to select from the existing list and assess the cooresponding code examples in the dark area to the right.</aside>
